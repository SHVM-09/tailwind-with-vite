## Introduction

Welcome to my Nike project repo, a showcase of seamless integration between Tailwind CSS, Vite, and post-processing technologies. 
This demonstration not only highlights the power of combining Tailwind CSS with Vite for efficient development but also introduces a unique feature – the Tailwind CSS class order corrector plugin. 
My project stands out with its capability to maintain a consistent class order across your stylesheets.

As a bonus, I've incorporated a sleek dark-light mode switcher, adding a touch of user-friendly customization to the mix. 
Explore the project to witness a harmonious blend of modern web development technologies, offering a glimpse into the future of web design.

Get ready to be inspired by the synergy of Tailwind CSS, Vite, and post-processing, and immerse yourself in a delightful web development experience. Let the journey begin!

I express my deep gratitude to [JS-mastery](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/nike_landing_page) for enhancing my proficiency in Tailwind CSS and generously sharing this valuable project!
